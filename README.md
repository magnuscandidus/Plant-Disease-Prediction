The Plant Disease Prediction project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify and predict diseases in plants. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the model accurately detects symptoms of diseases, enabling early intervention and treatment. This solution aims to help farmers and agricultural professionals reduce crop losses, improve yield, and adopt preventive measures in a timely manner. The project uses advanced algorithms for image classification and prediction, making it an efficient and scalable tool for modern agricultural practices.
